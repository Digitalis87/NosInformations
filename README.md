# NosInformations

I decided to open this repository to let people contribute with their knowledge about Nostale.

It's been made to grow the nostale modding, which is actually not that developed.

## How to contribute

We use GitHub pages (actually, it might change if this repository grow up to a better documentation software).
People that wanna contribute can do it two ways :
- Opening issues to help us know there are some missed parts in this documentation repository
- Opening Pull requests to help us fixing issues
